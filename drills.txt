Height of a BST
Write an algorithm to find the height of a binary search tree. What is the run time of your algorithm?

is it BST?
Write an algorithm to check whether an arbitrary binary tree is a binary search tree, assuming the tree does not contain duplicates

Third largest node
Write an algorithm to find the third largest node in a binary search tree

Balanced BST
Write an algorithm that checks if a BST is balanced (i.e. a tree where no two leaves differ in distance from the root by more than one).
